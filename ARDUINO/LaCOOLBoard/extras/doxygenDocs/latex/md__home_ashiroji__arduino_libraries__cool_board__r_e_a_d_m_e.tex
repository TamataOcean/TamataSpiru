\subsubsection*{Contribution guidelines}

For minor fixes of code and documentation, please go ahead and submit a pull request.

Larger changes (rewriting parts of existing code from scratch, adding new functions to the core, adding new libraries) should generally be discussed by opening an issue first.

Feature branches with lots of small commits (especially titled \char`\"{}oops\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}fix typo\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}forgot to add file\char`\"{}, etc.) should be squashed before opening a pull request. At the same time, please refrain from putting multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.
