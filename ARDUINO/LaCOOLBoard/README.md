Configuration Files :

-The CoolBoard API heavily uses the SPIFFS for storing and retreiving configuration and data files

This is a description of the configuration files and what are they used for :
  
  1/coolBoardConfig.json :
  
    logInterval: The time Interval to wait,in seconds, between two logs
	
    ireneActive: Put this flag to 1(true) if you are using the Irene3000 module
	
    jetpackActive:Put this flag to 1(true) if you are using the Jetpack modue
	
    externalSensorsActive: Put this flag to 1(true) if you are using a supported external Sensor
    
	sleepActive: Put this flag to 1(true) if you want your CoolBoard to enable Sleep mode
                 In Sleep Mode : your CoolBoard will do the following : -readSensors
                                                        				-activate Actors(if any)
																		-log the data
																		-check for updates
																		-go to sleep for logInterval period of time
	             
    userActive:Put this flag to 1(true) if you want your CoolBoard to collect userData : userName
																						 CoolBoard MAC Address 
																						 TimeStamp
                                                                                         
    manual /!\ : Put this flag to 1(true) to control to turn on/off your actors and bypass your initial actors configuration
                 
                 Be Careful with this mode!!.
                 
                 When this mode is actif , the CoolBoard will not restart automatically to apply any new configuration sent via
                 the update method.
                 
                 Restarting the coolBoard when in manual mode will deactivate all the actors!
                 
                 Never forget to reset this to false to go back to normal mode!


    saveAsJSON : Put this flag to one if you want that the coolboard saves messages which can not transmitted now in the SPIFFS 
    			 and sends them as soon as we have a connection. this is the best solution if you have no permanent connection.
    			 set it to zero if you have no internet at all and use the saveAsCSV Flag (smaller files).


    saveAsCSV :  This Flag saves the actual data as .csv file which can be opend in any openOffice, Excel...
    			 use this flag if you want to log for a long time without infrastructure around

  6/jetPackConfig.json and coolBoardActorConfig.json:
  
  	Act[i].actif: Put this flag to 1(true) in order to use the jetpack output Nï¿½i (0..7)
		
	Act[i].inverted:Put this flag to 1(true) if the actor is inverted (e.g : a cooler is activated when Temp>TempMax)
					Put this flag to 0(false) if the actor is notInverted(e.g : a heater is activated when Temp<TempMin)
						
	Act[i].temporal:Put this flag to 1(true) if you want the actor to be actif of a period of time  ,
					then inactif for another period of time.
						
	Act[i].type:["primaryType","secondaryType"] : this array contains the priamryType and the secondaryType of the actor
												 -The primaryType is the type associated to the sensors.
												 (e.g : primaryType : "Temperature" is associated to the sensor of type "Temperature").
												 -It can also be empty , in case of PURE temporal actors
                                                 
                                                 
												 -The secondaryType is only used in temporal mode.
												 it can be : -"" (empty):the actor will be on for a period of timeHigh ms
												 			 			 the actor will be off for a period of timeLow ms
															 
															 -"hour" :the actor will be on when the Hour is equal or greater then hourHigh
															 		  the actor will be off when the Hour is equal or greater then hourLow
															 
															 -"minute":the actor will be on when the Minute is equal or greater then minuteHigh
															 		  :the actor will be off when the Minute is equal or greater then minuteLow

                                                  /!\ NOTE  that if both primaryType and secondaryType are valid : the actor will be in
                                                     mixed mode : it will need to valid both Time and measurment conditions to go on or off
	
	Act[i].low:[rangeLow,timeLow,hourLow,minuteLow] : this array contains the values previously described:
													  -rangeLow is the minimum of the range at which 
													  to activate(deactivate in inverted mode) the actor
													  
													  -timeLow is the time spent off in temporal mode
													  
													  -hourLow is the hour to turn off the actor when secondaryType is hour or hourMinute
													  
													  -minuteLow is the minute to turn off the actor when secondaryType is minute or hourMinute
													  
													  
	Act[i].high:[rangeHigh,timeHigh,hourHigh,minuteHigh]: this array contains the values previously described:
													  -rangeHigh is the maximum of the range at which 
													  to deactivate(activate in inverted mode) the actor
													  
													  -timeHigh is the time spent on in temporal mode
													  
													  -hourHigh is the hour to turn on the actor when secondaryType is hour or hourMinute
													  
													  -minuteHigh is the minute to turn on the actor when secondaryType is minute or hourMinute
		
       
       Note that the coolBoardActorConfig.json contains only one Actor.

  	mqttServer: This is the mqttServer (ip/url) address
  	
  	user: This is the userId
  	
  	bufferSize: This is the memory allocated to the mqtt buffer in bytes
	
	inTopic : this is the topic that the coolBoard subscribes to (receives updates from ). You don't need to configure this since it is autogenerated by the API.
	
	outTopic : this is the topic that the coolBoard will publish to. You don't need to configure this since it is autogenerated by the API.
	


  8/rtcConfig.json:

  	NTP : syncronizes the RTC over a NTP Pool. !! Disable this if you don't have internet !!

### Contribution guidelines ###

For minor fixes of code and documentation, please go ahead and submit a pull request.

Larger changes (rewriting parts of existing code from scratch, adding new functions to the core, adding new libraries) 
should generally be discussed by opening an issue first.

Feature branches with lots of small commits (especially titled "oops", "fix typo", "forgot to add file", etc.) should be squashed before opening a pull request. 
At the same time, please refrain from putting multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.
